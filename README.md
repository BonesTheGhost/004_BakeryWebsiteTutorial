May 7th 2020::

Finished the tutorial on YouTube and created this repository as a way to reference the example work from multiple platforms.

This is a practice application for getting exploring CSS and Bootstrap (as well as some light JS and other tools). This is the first time I have seen bootstrap classes used instead of entirely overwritten, and it was certainly an eye-opening experience. The flexibility of Bootstraps built in styling classes that can be applied directly in HTML seem to be fairly useful in building a working (and decent looking) web application in a very short amount of time. I thoroughly enjoyed this tutorial.

As such, the code present in this repository is NOT ENTIRELY of my origin. What this means is that though I am following along with the videos step-by-step and manually entering the code and debugging in order to maximize the educational value, much of the core program is provided for learning purposes through the tutorial.

Personally, I enjoy attempting to alter the code as my abilities improve, or otherwise add in my own personal stylistic changes to make it my own (time permitting). Essentially, this repo should be viewed as proof of time and effort invested; exposure, relative skill-level, or level of experience.

The course can be found on YouTube.com with the title: "Build a responsive animated website [Part 1] | Bootstrap 4 Tutorial" (There are four parts in total at the time of writing this.)

All credit excluding my alterations given to Julio Codes. I fully recommend this tutorial!!

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Progress to this point:

Website is complete for now.

+ Refreshed CSS styling.
+ Refreshed HTML web-app building workflow prioritizing mobile devices first.
+ Learned about the "Animate On Scroll" library which is a really cool little addition for creating responsive front-end designs quickly. (I used the CDN here).
+ Learned about Font Awesome for the first time! I love the impact that quality icons can have on a finished website's level of polish. It's a detail that I will be keeping in mind moving forward.
+ Experienced using Bootstrap's own CSS styling IN ADDITION TO custom styling in a way that felt professional, efficient, and well executed. Subscribed to Julio's channel for this reason!
+ Got to see the impact of quality photos being prepared for this site, which further illustrated the proof that a site is a composition, not simply a set of functioning libraries that are stitched together.
